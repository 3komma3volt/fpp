<h3>Channel Remaps</h3>

<p>The Channel Remap page allows output channels to be remapped onto other channels before being sent out to controllers.  This can be use for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying 1 channel of data to another to work around a bad controller port</li>
<li>Copying multiple channels of data to replace a whole controller with another without having to reconfigure the replacement controller with the original controller's start channel configuration.</li>
<li>Duplicating channel data across two or more controllers for instance two identical matrices or pixel trees.</li>
</ul>
