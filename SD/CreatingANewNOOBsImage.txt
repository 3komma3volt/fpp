Instructions for creating a new FPP NOOBS SD image package
=============================================================================

Install the latest released SD image onto a SD card and boot it in your Pi.

Update the Pi to the latest kernel and packages using rpi-update:

	sudo rpi-update

Apply any other desired changes to the FPP install such as updating the FPP
SD image version listed in /etc/fpp/rfs_version

Shutdown the Pi cleanly and remove the SD card after power-off:

	sudo shutdown -h now

Install the SD card in another Linux computer containing this README.txt
file and the FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh shell script in the same directory.

Run FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh to create a new NOOBS compressed image from the SD
card with FPP installed.  You can use 'dd' to copy the SD image to a raw
file, or you can run FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh against the SD card directly as the
example below (make sure you get the right SCSI device).  The first
argument is the path to the SD image and the second argument is the FPP
version number which will be included in the output filename.

	sudo ./FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh /dev/sdc v0.3.0

If it complains about losetup but you have losetup installed, you may
need to 'su' to the root user first then run FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh.  This
depends on the path that is set when you 'sudo' which may not include
the path to losetup.

This should output a file called FPP-${VERSION}-NOOBS.img.xz where
${VERSION} is the version string passed on the command line.  This file
should be copied to the images directory in the NOOBS directory structure
with a destination filename of FPP.xz.

Re-create the NOOBS zip file containing the new FPP.xz image, and the
ZIP is ready for distribution.  Make sure the zip contains a subdirectory
with the NOOBS files in it and that zip is run with the -r option to
recurse into subdirs.  Most files in the NOOBS install are already
compressed, so there isn't much to be saved beween "zip -0" and "zip -9",
"-9" will only shave a few MegaBytes off the file size.

=============================================================================

Commands used during the creation of the v0.3.0-Beta SD image:

cd ~/src/fpp/SD/
sudo ./FPP_SD2NOOBS.sh /dev/sdc v0.3.0-Beta

Then in the parent directory of the NOOBS image (FPP-v0.3.0-Beta):

mv ~/src/fpp/SD/FPP-v0.3.0-Beta-NOOBS.img.xz FPP-v0.3.0-Beta/images/FPP.xz

zip -r -9 FPP-v0.3.0-Beta.zip FPP-v0.3.0-Beta
