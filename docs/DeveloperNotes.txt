-- Valgrind --

The version of Valgrind that is installable via apt-get is way too old (over 8 years old)
and will not really work for FPP on arm.   Many false positives occur, bunch of unhandled syscalls,
etc...   Building a more recent version of Valgrind from source is required:

Grab the current release from https://valgrind.org/downloads/current.html
Extract to a directory in /opt, run "./configure" and then "make ; make install"


-- ccache --
For the release branches, tar.gz's of the /root/.ccache directories are uploaded to
https://github.com/FalconChristmas/FalconChristmas.github.io/tree/master/ccache
so that when a user hits the "Upgrade" button, it will download the tar.gz, unpack it,
and then the build proceeds fairly quickly.  (assuming internet access)

For developer and master branch that changes often, updating the release ccaches would
be time consuming.  Instead, if ccache 4.6+ is available, there is a "secondary-storage"
option that will allow ccache to grab artifacts from a shared ccache on http://kulplights.com/ccache
To Enable, run:
ccache --set-config secondary_storage='http://kulplights.com/ccache|layout=flat|read-only=true'

That will provide read-only access to the Developer ccache.   For trusted developers that
have the required authorization tokens, the ccache can be read/write to share their
build artifacts with others:

ccache --set-config secondary_storage='http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@kulplights.com/ccache-upload|layout=flat|read-only=false'
ccache --set-config reshare=true

Note: there is an /opt/fpp/SD/buildCCACHE.sh script that can be run to build the required
version of ccache.  Debian currently does not include a recent enough version of ccache
and thus is must be build from source.
